        <h1>BLUELOCK</h1>
        <p>
          "The story begins with Japan's elimination from the 2018 FIFA World
          Cup, which prompts the Japanese Football Union to start a programme
          scouting high school players who will begin training in preparation
          for the 2022 Cup. Isagi Youichi, a forward, receives an invitation to
          this programme soon after his team loses the chance to go to Nationals
          because he passed to his less-skilled teammate —who missed— without
          trying to make the game-changing goal by himself. <br /><br />
          Their coach will be Ego Jinpachi, who intends to “destroy Japanese
          loser football” by introducing a radical new training regimen: isolate
          300 young strikers in a prison-like institution called “Blue Lock” and
          put them through rigorous training aimed at creating “the world's
          greatest egotist striker.”

            Started on November 20, 2018 , The BlueLock Project
            (青い監獄ブルーロックプロジェクト Burū Rokku Purojekuto?), or Player
            Improvement Project, is a special soccer project created by Jinpachi
            Ego and funded by the Japan Football Union with the intention of
            developing not only the best striker in the world, but a solitary
            hero for Japan that would lead the nation into finally winning the
            World Cup using Ego's extreme training regimens and coaching.
            Additionally, anyone who loses at Blue Lock would forever lose the
            right to play for Japan.

          <h1>1. Itoshi Rin</h1>
          <p>
            Brother of Japanese midfielder, Sae Itoshi.Rin Itoshi (糸いと師し
            凛りん Itoshi Rin?) is a contender of Blue Lock, who currently plays
            as a center forward for France's Paris X Gen in the Neo Egoist
            League.
            <br />
            Rin's main goal is to become the world's best striker. He used to be
            fixated on defeating his brother in football and in turn, getting
            revenge for abandoning their shared dream, but after the Blue Lock
            Eleven played against the Japan U-20 he let go of his revenge and
            decided to change so that he may become the world's best striker,
            defeating anybody in his path. Rin is an ideal candidate for the
            type of striker Ego strives to create.

            Bachira is a whimsical forward who plays following his instincts. He
            was a member of Team Z during the First Selection. His main goal was
            to find soccer rivals who also have a "monster" inside of them, but
            his goal later changes to becoming the best striker in the world
            when he overcomes his childhood trauma.
