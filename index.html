            <h1>BLUELOCK</h1>
            <p>"The story begins with Japan's elimination from the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which prompts the Japanese Football Union to start a programme scouting high school players who will begin training in preparation for the 2022 Cup. Isagi Youichi, a forward, receives an invitation to this programme soon after his team loses the chance to go to Nationals because he passed to his less-skilled teammate —who missed— without trying to make the game-changing goal by himself.
            <br><br>
            Their coach will be Ego Jinpachi, who intends to “destroy Japanese loser football” by introducing a radical new training regimen: isolate 300 young strikers in a prison-like institution called “Blue Lock” and put them through rigorous training aimed at creating “the world's greatest egotist striker.”</p>

                    <h3>Only one can be the best striker in the world</h3>
                    <p>Started on November 20, 2018 , The BlueLock Project (青い監獄ブルーロックプロジェクト Burū Rokku Purojekuto?), or Player Improvement Project, is a special soccer project created by Jinpachi Ego and funded by the Japan Football Union with the intention of developing not only the best striker in the world, but a solitary hero for Japan that would lead the nation into finally winning the World Cup using Ego's extreme training regimens and coaching. Additionally, anyone who loses at Blue Lock would forever lose the right to play for Japan.</p>

                <h1>1. Itoshi Rin </h1>
                <p>
                    Brother of Japanese midfielder, Sae Itoshi.Rin Itoshi (糸いと師し 凛りん Itoshi Rin?) is a contender of Blue Lock, who currently plays as a center forward for France's Paris X Gen in the Neo Egoist League.
                    <br>
                    Rin's main goal is to become the world's best striker. He used to be fixated on defeating his brother in football and in turn, getting revenge for abandoning their shared dream, but after the Blue Lock Eleven played against the Japan U-20 he let go of his revenge and decided to change so that he may become the world's best striker, defeating anybody in his path. Rin is an ideal candidate for the type of striker Ego strives to create.
